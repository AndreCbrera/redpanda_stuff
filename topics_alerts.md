Certainly! Here are example Prometheus alert rules for the most important Redpanda metrics related to **Throughput**, **Consumer Group Lag (Queues)**, and **Topics**, based strictly on the metrics and guidance from the knowledge sources.

---

## 1. Throughput Alerts

Monitor for abnormal drops or spikes in producer and consumer throughput using the following metrics:

- **Producer Throughput:** `redpanda_rpc_received_bytes` (filter: `redpanda_server="kafka"`)
- **Consumer Throughput:** `redpanda_rpc_sent_bytes` (filter: `redpanda_server="kafka"`)

**Example Prometheus alert rules:**

```yaml
groups:
  - name: Redpanda Throughput Alerts
    rules:
      - alert: RedpandaProducerThroughputLow
        expr: rate(redpanda_rpc_received_bytes{redpanda_server="kafka"}[5m]) < 1000
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Producer throughput is low"
          description: "Producer throughput has dropped below 1000 bytes/sec for 5 minutes."

      - alert: RedpandaConsumerThroughputLow
        expr: rate(redpanda_rpc_sent_bytes{redpanda_server="kafka"}[5m]) < 1000
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Consumer throughput is low"
          description: "Consumer throughput has dropped below 1000 bytes/sec for 5 minutes."
```
Adjust the threshold (`1000` bytes/sec) to fit your environmentâ€™s baseline.

## 2. Consumer Group Lag (Queues) Alerts

Monitor for lag in consumer groups using:

- **Maximum Lag:** `redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_max`
- **Total Lag:** `redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_sum`

**Example Prometheus alert rules:**

```yaml
groups:
  - name: Redpanda Consumer Lag Alerts
    rules:
      - alert: RedpandaConsumerGroupLagHigh
        expr: redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_max > 10000
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High consumer group lag"
          description: "The maximum consumer group lag has exceeded 10,000 messages for 10 minutes."

      - alert: RedpandaConsumerGroupTotalLagHigh
        expr: redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_lag_sum > 50000
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High total consumer group lag"
          description: "The total consumer group lag has exceeded 50,000 messages for 10 minutes."
```
Adjust lag thresholds as appropriate for your workload.

## 3. Topics Alerts

Monitor the number of topics being consumed by each consumer group:

- **Topics Consumed:** `redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_topics`

**Example Prometheus alert rule:**

```yaml
groups:
  - name: Redpanda Topic Alerts
    rules:
      - alert: RedpandaConsumerGroupNoTopics
        expr: redpanda_kafka_consumer_group_topics == 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Consumer group not consuming any topics"
          description: "A consumer group is not consuming any topics for 5 minutes."
```

**Note:**  
- These are example alert rules. You should tune thresholds and durations to match your environment and business requirements.
- To use these alerts, ensure you have enabled the relevant metrics in your Redpanda configuration as described in the documentation.

If you need more specific alerting scenarios or have a particular use case, let me know!
